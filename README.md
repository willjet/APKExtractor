
Android Application (.apk) file extractor and Parser for Android Binary XML

fork from https://code.google.com/archive/p/apk-extractor/

This project is an attempt to develop a publicly available parser which can parse Android's binary XML. AAPT (Android Asset Packaging Tool) encodes/decodes XML resources in Google's own proprietary binary XML format. It's a common believe that this is a generic WBXML format and any WBXML capable parser can parse it. But this is not true.
